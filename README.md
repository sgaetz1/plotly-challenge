This is the repository for my plot.ly homework. This assignment was to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The data reveals that some microbial species were present in more that 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. 

The url for the dashboard is https://sgaetz1.github.io/plotly-challenge/.

The dashboard includes a drop-down with which a user may select a different test subject by ID number. The Demographics Info contains information about the selected test subject. The horizontal bar chart shows the top ten OTUs (operational taxonomic units) found in that test subject's navel. The gauge shows the number of times per week the test subject washes their navel area. The bubble chart displays each sample of OTUs and the frequency of each.
